# Warm up

**Example:** You are testing seeds from a new plant variety. You plant 10 seeds (n=10) and observe that 3 of them successfully germinate (k=3). Consider two hypotheses about the true germination probability (p) for this variety:

Hypothesis A: 

Hypothesis B:

Given you observed 3 germinations out of 10 seeds, which hypothesis (A or B) is more supported by the data?

\vspace{3in}

In general, the *likelihood* of seeing $X=3$ given $p$ is: 

3 ways of finding the maximum: 

1. Approximate solution graphically

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 3
germ_function <- function(p) {choose(10,3) * p^3 * (1-p)^7} # define function
ggplot() + 
  geom_function(fun = germ_function) +
  xlim(c(0,1))
```

# **Example:** The median $m$ of an Exponential($\lambda$) distribution satisfies 
# P(X â‰¤ m) = 0.5. Solving $1 - e^{-\lambda m} = 0.5$ gives $m = ln(2) / \lambda$. 
# This suggests an estimator for $\lambda$ based on the median: 
#   $\widehat{\lambda} = \frac{ln(2)}{m}$. Finding the analytical variance of 
# $\widehat \lambda$ is complicated. Finding the sampling distribution of $m$ is 
# complicated, and finding the non-linear transformation is also complicated.
# 
# Use simulation to see whether $\frac{ln(2)}{m}$ (a) is unbiased and (b) achieves the CRLB

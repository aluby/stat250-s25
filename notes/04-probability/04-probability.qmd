## Central Limit Theorem

Suppose we have an iid sample $X_1, ..., X_n \sim F_x$. The CLT tells us that:

## Example: Binomial data

According to the 2004 American Community Survey, 28% of adults over 25 years old in Utah have completed a bachelor's degree. In a random sample of 64 adults over age 25 from Utah, what is the probability that at least 30 have a bachelor's degree?

# General Topics

## Terminology 

- Parameter vs Estimator
- Estimator vs Estimate
- pdf vs likelihood
- sample vs population

## Sampling distributions


## Estimation

- Finding the MLE
- Finding the MoM

## Evaluating estimators

- Given a pdf, find the expected value and variance
- Recognize named distributions
- Use properties of expected value and variance
- Comment on bias and efficiency using the theoretical expected value and variance or using results from a simulation
- Determine the Cramer-Rao lower bound
- Compare two estimators' efficiency in terms of sample size
- Determine if an estimator is consistent 
- Use large-sample properties of the MLE

## Math skills

- Integration: polynomials, $e^x$, $\ln x$, and less-involved composite functions (ie $\int \ln 2x$)
- Derivatives: same as integration

## R skills

- Given simulation code and output, draw conclusions
- Given a graph and a description, draw conclusions

# Example problems

# R implementation examples from class

## Theoretical example

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
sample_data <- rgamma(50, 2, 2)
mean(sample_data)
sd(sample_data)
```

### Bootstrap distribution

```{r}
n_sims <- 10^5
boot_dsn <- numeric(n_sims)
for(i in 1:n_sims){
  boot_dsn[i] <- mean(sample(sample_data, length(sample_data), replace = TRUE))
}

mean(boot_dsn)
sd(boot_dsn)
```

### Sampling distribution

```{r}
n_sims <- 10^5
sampling_dsn <- numeric(n_sims)
for(i in 1:n_sims){
  sampling_dsn[i] <- mean(rgamma(50, 2, 2))
}

mean(sampling_dsn)
sd(sampling_dsn)
```

## Data example

```{r bootstrap-example-code, results='hide'}
#| echo: true

data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

# Subsetting to get only one species
gentoo <- dplyr::filter(penguins, species == "Gentoo")

# Bookkeeping
y <- gentoo$bill_length_mm
n <- nrow(gentoo)        # sample size
N <- 10^4                # desired no. resamples
boot_means <- numeric(N) # a place to store the bootstrap stats

# Resampling from the sample
for (i in 1:N) {
  x <- sample(y, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  boot_means[i] <- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)  # you can choose other statistics
}
# Calculate a 95% percentile interval
quantile(boot_means, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))
```


## Your turn: theoretical example {.scrollable}

Consider a population that has a gamma distribution with parameters
r=5, 𝜆=1∕4.

(a) Use simulation (with n = 200) to generate an approximate sampling distribution of the mean; plot and describe the distribution.
(b) Now, draw one random sample of size 200 from this population. Create a histogram of your sample and find the mean and standard deviation.
(c) Compute the bootstrap distribution of the mean for your sample, plot it, and note the bootstrap mean and standard error.
(d) Compare the bootstrap distribution to the approximate theoretical sampling distribution by creating a table like slide 17


Repeat (a)–(e) for sample sizes of n = 50 and n = 10. Describe carefully your observations about the effects of sample size on the bootstrap distribution.

## Your turn: data example  {.scrollable}

The `Bangladesh` data set contains information about arsenic, cobalt, and chlorine concentrations from a sample of 271 water wells in Bangladesh. 

```{r}
library(resampledata3)
library(tidyverse)
```

(a) Conduct EDA on the chlorine concentrations and describe the
salient features.
(b) Find the bootstrap distribution of the mean.
(c) Find and interpret the 95% bootstrap percentile confidence interval.
(d) What is the bootstrap estimate of the bias? What fraction of the
bootstrap standard error does it represent?

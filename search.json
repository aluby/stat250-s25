    "text": "Regrade request policy\nGrading is often a tedious task, and the grading team will sometimes make mistakes. I am always happy to fix these mistakes, and gradescope makes it easy to do so. However, it takes time to read through these requests and I’ve noticed an increase in unwarranted regrade requests in recent years. This semester, I am instituting an “NFL Coaches Challenge”-style regrade request rule. Every student will start the semester with 2 regrade requests available to them. If you submit a regrade request and I agree with you, you get it back. If you submit a regrade request for something that was not a grading mistake, you lose that request."

Understanding statistical concepts and working with R can be frustrating at times, but people are here to help you along the way!\nDon’t let work snowball! Try to get help early and often and an imperfect problem set is better than no problem set.\nlots of R here! Organization is key, and you’ll do well as long as you start homeworks early, communicate with the professor and with your fellow classmates. There’s a good support system."

    "text": "The “Genius Myth”\nIt’s sometimes easy to buy into the “genius myth” when it comes to math/stat courses: that you need to be a “math person” and have some innate mathematical ability in order to do well or become a statistics major. This could not be further from the truth! The best statisticians don’t necessarily have the “best” math or programming background, but are people that are able to formulate interesting questions and use math and programming to rigorously answer those questions. Many of the best statisticians I know became statisticians because they were initially interested in something else (biology, public health, psychology, neuroscience, physics, etc.) and realized that being able to answer important questions with data was not only valuable but fun and interesting. Being able to perform interesting statistical analyses is a skill that is learned, not an innate ability, and working hard at developing that skill is the point of this course."

There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help.

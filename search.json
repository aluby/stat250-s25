Of course you can! The assignment operator (&lt;-) is unique to R and I try to use it when assigning objects. If the = sign comes more naturally to you, that’s also just fine\n\n\nAt first, we’ll be creating a lot of data objects. For example, we an load a data set containing the ratings for each episode of The Office using the code\n\noffice_ratings &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-17/office_ratings.csv\")\n\nIn this class you will be creating a lot of objects, so you’ll need to come up with names for those objects. Trying to think of informative/meaningful names for objects is hard, but necessary work! Below are the fundamental rules for naming objects in R:\n\nnames can’t start with a number\nnames are case-sensitive\nsome common letters are used internally by R and should be avoided as variable names (c, q, t, C, D, F, T, I)\nThere are reserved words that R won’t let you use for variable names (for, in, while, if, else, repeat, break, next)\nR will let you use the name of a predefined function—but don’t do it!\n\nYou can always check to see if you the name you want to use is already taken via exists():\nFor example lm exists\n\nexists(\"lm\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nbut carleton_college doesn’t.\n\nexists(\"carleton_college\")\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nThere are also a lot of naming styles out there, and if you have coded in another language, you may have already developed a preference. Below is an illustration by Allison Horst\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI generally following the tidyverse style guide, so you’ll see that I use only lowercase letters, numbers, and _ (snake case)."

    "text": "Extracting pieces of data frames\nSince data frames are the fundamental data structure for most analyses in R, it’s important to know how to work with them. You already know how to get an overview of a data frame, but that isn’t always very informative. Often, you want to extract pieces of a data frame, such as a specific column or row.\n\nExtracting rows\nData frames can be indexed by their row/column numbers. To extract elements of a data frame, the basic syntax is data_set[row.index, column.index]. So, to extract the 10th row of office_ratings we run\n\noffice_ratings[10, ]\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  season episode title    imdb_rating total_votes air_date  \n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;    \n1      2       4 The Fire         8.4        2713 2005-10-11\n\n\nNotice that to extract an entire row, we leave the column index position blank.\nWe can also extract multiple rows by creating a vector of row indices. For example, we can extract the first 5 rows via\n\noffice_ratings[1:5, ]\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 6\n  season episode title         imdb_rating total_votes air_date  \n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;    \n1      1       1 Pilot                 7.6        3706 2005-03-24\n2      1       2 Diversity Day         8.3        3566 2005-03-29\n3      1       3 Health Care           7.9        2983 2005-04-05\n4      1       4 The Alliance          8.1        2886 2005-04-12\n5      1       5 Basketball            8.4        3179 2005-04-19\n\n\nHere, 1:5 create a sequence of integers from 1 to 5.\nWe could also specify arbitrary row index values by combing the values into a vector. For example, we could extract the 1st, 13th, 64th, and 128th rows via\n\noffice_ratings[c(1, 13, 64, 128), ]\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 6\n  season episode title            imdb_rating total_votes air_date  \n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;    \n1      1       1 Pilot                    7.6        3706 2005-03-24\n2      2       7 The Client               8.6        2631 2005-11-08\n3      4      13 Job Fair                 7.9        1977 2008-05-08\n4      7      11 Classy Christmas         8.9        2138 2010-12-09\n\n\n\n\nExtracting columns\nSimilar to extracting rows, we can use a numeric index to extract the columns of a data frame. For example, to extract the 3rd column, we can run\n\noffice_ratings[,3]\n\n# A tibble: 188 × 1\n   title            \n   &lt;chr&gt;            \n 1 Pilot            \n 2 Diversity Day    \n 3 Health Care      \n 4 The Alliance     \n 5 Basketball       \n 6 Hot Girl         \n 7 The Dundies      \n 8 Sexual Harassment\n 9 Office Olympics  \n10 The Fire         \n# ℹ 178 more rows\n\n\nAlternatively, we can pass in the column name in quotes instead of the column number\n\noffice_ratings[,\"title\"]\n\n# A tibble: 188 × 1\n   title            \n   &lt;chr&gt;            \n 1 Pilot            \n 2 Diversity Day    \n 3 Health Care      \n 4 The Alliance     \n 5 Basketball       \n 6 Hot Girl         \n 7 The Dundies      \n 8 Sexual Harassment\n 9 Office Olympics  \n10 The Fire         \n# ℹ 178 more rows\n\n\nNotice that the extracted column is still formatted as a data frame (or tibble). If you want to extract the contents of the column and just have a vector of titles, you have a few options.\n\nYou could use double brackets with the column number:\n\n\noffice_ratings[[3]]\n\n\nYou could use double brackets with the column name in quotes:\n\n\noffice_ratings[[\"title\"]]\n\n\nYou could use the $ extractor with the column name (not in quotes):\n\n\noffice_ratings$title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Check point\n\n\n\n\nExtract the 35th row of office_ratings.\nExtract rows 35, 36, 37, and 38 of office_ratings.\nExtract the imdb_rating column from office ratings using the column index number.\nExtract the imdb_rating column from office ratings using the column name."

In a data frame, each column is an element of the data list and each column must be of the same length.

    "section": "Vectors",
    "text": "Vectors\nThe columns of the office_ratings data frame and the elements of the mast list were comprised of (atomic) vectors. Unlike lists, all elements within a vector share the same type. For example, all names in the stat_faculty vector were character strings and all ratings in the imdb_rating column were numeric. We’ll deal with a variety of types of vectors in this course, including:\n\nnumeric\ncharacter (text)\nlogical (TRUE/FALSE)\n\n\nExtracting elements of a vector\nJust like with lists (and therefore data frames), we use brackets to extract elements from a vector. As an example, let’s work with the title column from office_ratings.\n\ntitle &lt;- office_ratings$title # vector of titles\n\nTo extract the 111th title, we run\n\ntitle[111]\n\n[1] \"New Leads\"\n\n\nor two extract the 100th through 111th titles, we run\n\ntitle[100:111]\n\n [1] \"Double Date\"          \"Murder\"               \"Shareholder Meeting\" \n [4] \"Scott's Tots\"         \"Secret Santa\"         \"The Banker\"          \n [7] \"Sabre\"                \"Manager and Salesman\" \"The Delivery: Part 1\"\n[10] \"The Delivery: Part 2\" \"St. Patrick's Day\"    \"New Leads\"           \n\n\n\n\nNegative indices\nSometimes, we want to “kick out” elements of our vector. To do this, we can use a negative index value. For example,\n\ntitle[-1]\n\nreturns all but the first title—that is, it kicks out the first title. To kick out multiple elements, we need to negate a vector of indices. For example, below we kick out the first 10 titles\n\ntitle[-c(1:10)]\n\nAnd now we kick out the 5th, 50th, and 150th titles\n\ntitle[-c(5, 50, 150)]\n\nThis idea can be adapted to lists and data frames. For example, to kick out the first row of office_ratings, we run\n\noffice_ratings[-1,]\n\n# A tibble: 187 × 6\n   season episode title             imdb_rating total_votes air_date  \n    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;    \n 1      1       2 Diversity Day             8.3        3566 2005-03-29\n 2      1       3 Health Care               7.9        2983 2005-04-05\n 3      1       4 The Alliance              8.1        2886 2005-04-12\n 4      1       5 Basketball                8.4        3179 2005-04-19\n 5      1       6 Hot Girl                  7.8        2852 2005-04-26\n 6      2       1 The Dundies               8.7        3213 2005-09-20\n 7      2       2 Sexual Harassment         8.2        2736 2005-09-27\n 8      2       3 Office Olympics           8.4        2742 2005-10-04\n 9      2       4 The Fire                  8.4        2713 2005-10-11\n10      2       5 Halloween                 8.2        2561 2005-10-18\n# ℹ 177 more rows\n\n\nor to kick out the math courses from the mast list we run\n\nmast[-4]\n\n$stat_faculty\n[1] \"Kelling\"   \"Loy\"       \"Luby\"      \"Poppick\"   \"St. Clair\" \"Wadsworth\"\n\n$stat_courses\n[1] 120 220 230 250 285 330\n\n$math_faculty\n [1] \"Brooke\"              \"Davis\"               \"Egge\"               \n [4] \"Gomez-Gonzales\"      \"Haunsperger\"         \"Johnson\"            \n [7] \"Meyer\"               \"Montee\"              \"Shrestha\"           \n[10] \"Terry\"               \"Thompson\"            \"Turnage-Butterbaugh\"\n\n\n\n\nLogical indices\nIt’s great to be able to extract (or omit) elements using indices, but sometimes we don’t know what index value we should use. For example, if you wanted to extract all of the 300-level statistics courses from the stat_courses vector, you would need to manually determine that positions 2:5 meet that requirement. That’s a lot of work! A better alternative is to allow R to find the elements meeting that requirement using logical operators. Below is a table summarizing common logical operators in R.\n\n\n\nComparison\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n&lt;=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n==\nis equal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\n\nIn order to extract the 300-level statistics courses, we’ll take two steps:\n\nWe’ll determine whether each course is numbered at least 300,\nthen we’ll use that sequence of TRUEs/FALSEs to extract the course.\n\nSo, first we use the logical operator &gt;= to compare stat_courses and 300. This returns TRUE if the element meets the specification and FALSE otherwise.\n\nstat_courses &gt;= 300\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nNow, we can use this vector as our index. Only the TRUE elements will be extracted:\n\nstat_courses[stat_courses &gt;= 300]\n\n[1] 330\n\n\nThe same idea can be used with data frames and lists, just remember how to format the brackets and indices!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Check point\n\n\n\n\nExtract all statistics courses below 250 from stat_courses.\nExtract all math courses except for 240 (probability) from math_courses.\nExtract all rows from season 3 of The Office."

    "section": "",
    "text": "library(tidyverse)\n\nThe goal for today is to understand the concept of a sampling distribution by comparing theoretical results with simulation results using R. We will investigate the sampling distributions of the sample mean.\nYou’ve been assigned to groups of 3-4 for this activity. You should submit your rendered file on gradescope as a group assignment. If folks from your assigned group did not show up, groups of 2 can combine into groups of 4.\n\nIntroduction\nA sampling distribution is the probability distribution of a statistic (like the sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) or sample variance \\(s^2\\)) obtained through a large number of samples drawn from a specific population. Understanding sampling distributions is crucial for statistical inference, as it allows us to make probability statements about sample statistics. In this activity, we will generate empirical sampling distributions through simulation and compare them to theoretical results.\nAlong the way, you’ll get some practice in R and some probability review.\n\n\nPart 1: Sampling distribution of the mean (Normal population)\nAssume data points \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) are sampled from a normally distributed population\n\nIf \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), what is the expected value \\(E[\\bar{X}]\\) and theoretical standard deviation of \\(\\bar{X}\\) (also known as the standard error)?\nWhat is the theoretical distribution of \\(\\bar{X}\\)? (Note: you do not need to prove/derive this!)\n\nLet’s simulate this. Assume our population is \\(N(50, 10^2)\\) (so \\(\\sigma=10\\)). We will draw samples of size n = 25:\n\npop_mean &lt;- 50\npop_sd &lt;- 10\nsample_size &lt;- 25\nn_simulations &lt;- 100\n\nsample_means &lt;- numeric(n_simulations)\n\nfor(i in 1:n_simulations){\n  x &lt;- rnorm(sample_size, mean = pop_mean, sd = pop_sd)\n  sample_means[i] &lt;- mean(x)\n}\n\n\nWhat is the mean of sample_means? How close is it to \\(E[\\bar{X}]\\) above?\nWhat is the sd of sample_means? How close is it to the theoretical standard error you found above?\nThe code below makes a histogram of sample_means and overlays an incorrect theoretical density curve on top. Replace pop_mean and pop_sd with the theoretical values that you found in Q1.\n\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  sample_means = sample_means\n)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = sample_means)) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(density)), col = \"white\", bins = 20) + \n  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = pop_mean, s = pop_sd), col = \"cornflowerblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry different values for sample_size and n_simulations. When does the histogram match the theoretical density most closely?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\n\n\nYou have (hopefully) just demonstrated the Central Limit Theorem in action. Nice work! The CLT tells us that, as our sample size approaches \\(\\infty\\),\n\\[F_\\bar{X}(\\bar{X}) \\to N(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}})\\]\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Non-normal population\nWe often use the Exponential distribution to model the time until an event occurs in a process where events happen randomly and independently at a constant average rate (a Poisson process). A common example is the time between consecutive arrivals of customers, like a coffee shop, during a period where the arrival rate is relatively stable. The key parameter is the rate \\(\\lambda\\) (e.g., average customers per minute) or its reciprocal, the mean time \\(\\mu = 1/\\lambda\\) (e.g., average minutes between customers). Individual inter-arrival times will follow a skewed distribution (many short times, fewer long times), but the CLT tells us something interesting about the average of these times if we look at many samples.\n\nLet \\(X\\) be the time (in minutes) between consecutive customer arrivals at a small coffee shop during a specific hour. Suppose this time can be modeled by an Exponential distribution. We observe that, on average over a long period of time, a customer arrives every 5 minutes. This average time is the mean of the distribution, \\(\\mu = 5\\) minutes. What is the rate, \\(\\lambda\\)? What is \\(E[X]\\) and \\(\\sigma_X\\)? (You can use the distributions cheat sheet in the back of the book)\nThe code below plots a theoretical exponential distribution with \\(\\lambda=1\\). Change it to the appropriate value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the CLT, if we take a sample of n = 40 consecutive inter-arrival times, what should the approximate distribution of the average inter-arrival time (\\(\\bar{X}\\)) be across many such samples? What are its approximate mean and standard error?\nLet’s check our answers through simulation. Replace all _____ with appropriate values in the code chunk below, and then remove the line with #| eval: false.\n\n\npop_lambda &lt;- ____\nsample_size &lt;- ____\nn_simulations &lt;- 1000\n\nsample_means &lt;- numeric(n_simulations)\n\nfor(i in 1:n_simulations){\n  x &lt;- rexp(sample_size, rate = pop_lambda)\n  sample_means[i] &lt;- mean(x)\n}\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  sample_means = sample_means\n)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = sample_means)) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(density)), col = \"white\", bins = 20) + \n  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = ______, s = ______), col = \"cornflowerblue\")\n\n\nHow well does the normal curve approximate the distribution of the average inter-arrival times, even though the distribution of individual inter-arrival times is heavily skewed (Exponential)?\nWhat happens if the sample size n is much smaller (e.g., \\(n=5\\))?\n\n\n\nPart 3: Discrete data\nThe true magic of the CLT is that it applies to any probability distribution, even discrete ones!\nExample: According to the 2004 American Community Survey, 28% of adults over 25 years old in Utah have completed a bachelor’s degree. In a random sample of 64 adults over age 25 from Utah, what is the probability that at least 30 have a bachelor’s degree?\nLet \\(X_i\\) indicate whether a sampled person has a bachelor’s degree. Then, \\(X_1, ...., X_n \\sim Binom(n,p)\\).\n\nWhat is \\(n\\) and what is \\(p\\)?\n\nWe are interested in how many people have a bachelor’s degree, or \\(\\frac{\\sum X_i}{n}\\). This is also an \\(\\bar{X}\\)!\n\nUse the CLT to find \\(E[\\hat{p}]\\) and \\(s_{\\hat{p}}\\).\nUse the normal distribution to find \\(P(\\bar{X} &gt; .3)\\) (Hint: use pnorm)\nAlternatively, we can answer this question through simulation. Use sample_means to estimate this probability. How close are you to your answer from (3)?\n\n\npop_p &lt;- .28\nsample_size &lt;- 64\nn_simulations &lt;- 1000\n\nsample_means &lt;- numeric(n_simulations)\n\nfor(i in 1:n_simulations){\n  x &lt;- rbinom(1, size = sample_size, prob = pop_p)\n  sample_means[i] &lt;- x/sample_size\n}\n\n\n\nPart 4: Summary and Reflection\n\nWhat is the difference between a population distribution, sample distribution, and distribution of a sample?\nWhy is the CLT important?\nGive one benefit of finding sampling distributions theoretically with probability\nGive one benefit of finding sampling distributions computationally through simulation\nDoes your group have any lingering questions for me?"

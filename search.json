However, it takes time to read through these requests and I’ve noticed an increase in unwarranted regrade requests in recent years. This semester, I am instituting an “NFL Coaches Challenge”-style regrade request rule. Every student will start the semester with 2 regrade requests available to them. If you submit a regrade request and I agree with you, you get it back. If you submit a regrade request for something that was not a grading mistake, you lose that request."

Understanding statistical concepts and working with R can be frustrating at times, but people are here to help you along the way!\nDon’t let work snowball! Try to get help early and often and an imperfect problem set is better than no problem set.\nlots of R here!

This could not be further from the truth! The best statisticians don’t necessarily have the “best” math or programming background, but are people that are able to formulate interesting questions and use math and programming to rigorously answer those questions. Many of the best statisticians I know became statisticians because they were initially interested in something else (biology, public health, psychology, neuroscience, physics, etc.) and realized that being able to answer important questions with data was not only valuable but fun and interesting. Being able to perform interesting statistical analyses is a skill that is learned, not an innate ability, and working hard at developing that skill is the point of this course."

I’m online sporadically on evenings and weekends to devote time to family and rest – I hope you also use this time to reset and recharge!"

Understanding statistical concepts and working with R can be frustrating at times, but people are here to help you along the way!\nDon’t let work snowball! Try to get help early and often and an imperfect problem set is better than no problem set.\nStart the homework early! Give yourself time to get things done, to understand, and to pause. Don’t feel afraid to ask questions; she’s so accessible.\nSpend some time reviewing handouts before doing homework."

    "section": "The “Genius Myth”",
    "text": "The “Genius Myth”\nIt’s sometimes easy to buy into the “genius myth” when it comes to math/stat courses: that you need to be a “math person” and have some innate mathematical ability in order to do well or become a statistics major. This could not be further from the truth! The best statisticians don’t necessarily have the “best” math or programming background, but are people that are able to formulate interesting questions and use math and programming to rigorously answer those questions. Many of the best statisticians I know became statisticians because they were initially interested in something else (biology, public health, psychology, neuroscience, physics, etc.) and realized that being able to answer important questions with data was not only valuable but fun and interesting. Being able to perform interesting statistical analyses is a skill that is learned, not an innate ability, and working hard at developing that skill is the point of this course."

    "text": "Academic Integrity\nYou are expected to follow Carleton’s policies regarding academic integrity. I encourage you to discuss the homework problems with others and use the resources available to you to try to figure out tough problems. You should code and write up your solutions on your own. Exams must be done by yourself without communicating with others; all work must be your own. The use of textbook solution manuals (physical or online), course materials from other students, or materials from previous versions of this course are not allowed. Copying, paraphrasing, summarizing, or submitting work generated by anyone but yourself without proper attribution is considered academic dishonesty (this includes output from LLMs).\nPlease ask if you are unsure of whether or not your actions are complying with the assignment/exam/project instructions. Always default to acknowledging any help received. Cases of suspected academic dishonesty are handled by the Provost’s Office and I am obligated to report any suspected violations of this policy."

You may not record my lectures using tools such as Otter.ai or upload any video or audio recordings to generate transcripts or study notes. You may not upload my course materials (slides, assignment prompts, note sets, etc.) into AI tools or homework help sites (such as chegg).\n“AI” tools are new for all of us and it’s OK to have questions about what is and isn’t appropriate!"
